/**
 * Annotates an OSGi Component class with its dependencies. Components are the main building 
 * blocks for OSGi applications. They can publish themselves as a service, and/or they can have 
 * dependencies. These dependencies will influence their life cycle as component will only be 
 * activated when all required dependencies are available. 
 * By default, all directly implemented interfaces are registered into the OSGi registry,
 * and the component is instantiated automatically, when the component bundle is started and 
 * when the component dependencies are available. If you need to take control of when and how 
 * much component instances must be created, then you can use the <code>factorySet</code> 
 * annotation attribute.<p> 
 * If a <code>factorySet</code> attribute is set, the component is not started automatically 
 * during bundle startup, and a <code>java.util.Set&lt;Dictionary&gt;</code> 
 * object is registered into the OSGi registry on behalf of the component. This Set will act 
 * as a Factory API, and another component may use this Set and add some configuration 
 * dictionaries in it, in order to fire some component activations (there is one component 
 * instantiated per dictionary, which is passed to component instances via a configurable 
 * callback method).
 *
 * <h3>Usage Examples</h3>
 * 
 * <p> Here is a sample showing a X component, which depends on a configuration dependency:<p>
 * <blockquote>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * &#47;**
 *   * This component will be activated once the bundle is started and when all required dependencies
 *   * are available.
 *   *&#47;
 * &#64;Component
 * class X implements Z {
 *     &#64;ConfigurationDependency(pid="MyPid")
 *     void configure(Dictionary conf) {
 *          // Configure or reconfigure our component.
 *     }
 *   
 *     &#64;Start
 *     void start() {
 *         // Our component is starting and is about to be registered in the OSGi registry as a Z service.
 *     }
 *   
 *     public void doService() {
 *         // ...
 *     }   
 * }
 * </pre>
 * </blockquote>
 * 
 * Here is a sample showing how a Y component may dynamically instantiate several X component instances, 
 * using the {@link #factorySet()} attribute:<p>
 * <blockquote>
 * 
 * <pre>
 *  &#47;**
 *    * All component instances will be created/updated/removed by the "Y" component
 *    *&#47;
 *  &#64;Component(factorySet="MyComponentFactory", factoryConfigure="configure")
 *  class X implements Z {                 
 *      void configure(Dictionary conf) {
 *          // Configure or reconfigure our component. The conf is provided by the factory,
 *          // and all public properties (which don't start with a dot) are propagated with the
 *          // service properties specified in the properties annotation attribute.
 *      }
 * 
 *      &#64;ServiceDependency
 *      void bindOtherService(OtherService other) {
 *          // store this require dependency
 *      }
 *      
 *      &#64;Start
 *      void start() {
 *          // Our component is starting and is about to be registered in the OSGi registry as a Z service.
 *      } 
 *      
 *      public void doService() {
 *          // ...
 *      }   
 *  }
 * 
 *  &#47;**
 *    * This class will instantiate some X component instances
 *    *&#47;
 *  &#64;Component 
 *  class Y {
 *      &#64;ServiceDependency(filter="(dm.factory.name=MyComponentFactory)")
 *      Set&lt;Dictionary&gt; _XFactory; // This Set acts as a Factory API for creating X component instances.
 *    
 *      &#64;Start
 *      void start() {
 *          // Instantiate a X component instance
 *          Dictionary x1 = new Hashtable() {{ put("foo", "bar1"); }};
 *          _XFactory.add(x1);
 *      
 *          // Instantiate another X component instance
 *          Dictionary x2 = new Hashtable() {{ put("foo", "bar2"); }};
 *          _XFactory.add(x2);
 *      
 *          // Update the first X component instance
 *          x1.put("foo", "bar1_modified");
 *          _XFactory.add(x1);
 *          
 *          // Instantiate a third X instance, by explicitly providing the implementation object
 *          Dictionary x3 = new Hashtable() {{ put(Component.FACTORY_INSTANCE, new X()); }};
 *          _XFactory.add(x3);
 *      
 *          // Destroy x1/x2/x3 components (Notice that invoking XFactory.clear() will destroy all X component  instances).
 *          _XFactory.remove(x1);
 *          _XFactory.remove(x2); 
 *          _XFactory.remove(x3); 
 *      }
 *  }
